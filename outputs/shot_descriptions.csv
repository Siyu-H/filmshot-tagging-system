1.1,Power Move,"There are times when you want one character to frighten or threaten another. You can do this by having each of them move in on the other character’s space as they talk. These shots from Defiance show how a subtle difference in camera position and lens choice creates this effect. The opening shot is filmed with a relatively low camera, tilted up slightly. This contrasts with the next shot, which is shot at head height. This creates the feeling that the first character is stronger, or more domineering, because he is looking down. The first shot is also shot with a shorter lens, so that when the actor moves forward a couple of steps, his movement is exaggerated and he appears to loom forward. The camera also tilts up, making him seem even more domineering. The short lens exaggerates this tilt upward. If the other actor was shot with a short lens, the contrast between them would not be there. The contrast works as described above, but also helps to establish who is “good” and who is “bad.” A short lens tends to make somebody more frightening, while a long lens makes them more appealing. By using contrasting lenses at a pivotal moment in the film, you tell your audience as clearly as possible who is good and who is bad. If you watch this scene in full, you will notice that they did shoot a low angle of the second character, with a shorter lens, but it is barely used, being there only to connect the shots. This suggests that the effect described here may have been discovered in the editing room, rather than planned from the outset. If you plan to shoot in this way, remember that combining three forms of contrast creates the effect. One camera stays still, while the other tilts. One shot is wide, the other long. One camera is low, and the other is at head height. It is only by combining these three forms that the full effect is created. Defiance. Directed by Edward Zwick. Paramount Vantage, 2008.

1.2,Doorway,"Conflict always brings interest to a scene, but there are times when character conflict may be almost incidental. You need to shoot these scenes in a way that keeps the focus on the story and the roles of the main characters. In this scene from The International, the character in the apartment is incidental, and although there is some brief conflict with him, it’s important that we remain focused on how the other characters respond to this conflict. The scene opens with a brief master shot to make it clear where everybody is positioned in relationship to the door. We then cut to an over-the-shoulder shot of Clive Owen. The camera is quite low here, to emphasize that he’s the hero. With the geography of the scene well established, it’s possible to cut to the cops on either side of the door without any confusion. The ideal setup, as shown here, has the farthest character in focus, with the other two out of focus. A long lens will help generate this shallow depth of field and capture the reaction of the farthest character. The other cops even turn their attention away from the incidental character, which further emphasizes that this scene is really about Clive Owen’s character establishing his authority, rather than on the plot revelations. Doorways are interesting to directors because they act as barriers, or thresholds that may need to be crossed. Conversations held on these thresholds are tantalizing, because nobody is sure which way the balance of power will fall. This is far more interesting than having two characters come to the door, go inside, and have a chat. When shooting this sort of scene, the setups can be quite basic with little movement from actors or camera. The way you direct the actors to focus their attention is the key to how this scene will play out when cut. The International. Directed by Tom Tykwer. Columbia Pictures, 2009. All rights reserved."
1.3,Offset Group,"The more subtle the conflict, the more subtle your camera work needs to be. If you want your character to feel left out of a conversation, a simple arrangement of actors and camera can create the desired effect. In this scene from Lost in Translation, the characters are arranged in a triangle. They are all equal distances from each other, but rather than creating a feeling of equality, this creates some power imbalance, because two of them are a couple and should probably be closer together. To emphasize this, the opening shot is taken from behind the couple, so that the interloper is almost central in the frame. This makes her seem significant to the audience, and it is clear that she is invading their territory. The next shot places Scarlett Johansson in the center of frame. Given what has just been said about putting somebody in the center of frame, you would think this would make her the dominant character. But this time a longer lens is used, closer to the actors; this means their faces frame her as they talk. She is left out of the conversation, looking across from one character to the other. She remains the focus of the audience, but is not the focus of the other two characters, because they are talking to each other intently. This is an extremely clever way of keeping our focus on the central character, while making her feel left out of the conversation. Lost in Translation. Directed by Sofia Coppola.

1.4,Crossing Lines,"Directors usually take great care to make sure the audience knows exactly where they are situated in a scene. When you establish the geography of a scene clearly, the audience knows exactly where everybody is, and who’s talking to whom. Out of this need for clarity, a set of rules has evolved around exactly where the camera should be in any scene. By breaking these rules, carefully and at the right time, you can add to the scene’s sense of conflict. If this scene from 21 Grams was shot conventionally, the cameras would always stay on one side of the characters. Instead, the camera switches to the opposite side with the cut. This is called crossing the line, and most of the time directors are told not to cross the line. Imagine a line between the two characters (if they were facing each other). In normal situations, you keep the camera on one side of that line. Here, though, with the first cut, the camera switches from being on her right-shoulder side to being on her left-shoulder side. The next cut remains on her left shoulder. If you watch the whole scene, you see actors walk in without facing each other, and the camera sometimes pans from one to the other. At other times these cuts across the line are made. The overall feeling is one of disorientation. We don’t actually become disorientated, because we know they are talking to each other, but the constant moves and shifts make for an uneasy, restless feeling that captures the emotion of the argument well. By having him wait for an elevator, the director is able to have him turn his back on her plausibly. Equally, there isn’t room for her to move around in front of him, which justifies her standing behind him. You should always look for good reasons to justify the way your characters stand and move, because it helps to add realism and makes the actors more comfortable with their performances. 21 Grams. Directed by Alejandro Gonzãlez Iñárritu. Focus Features, 2003. All rights reserved."
1.5,Barrier,"When people are in conflict, something stands between them. You can make this idea literal, by putting a physical barrier between them in the scene. It may be a table or chair, or even, as in this example, a wall and window. A physical barrier gives characters more of a justification to shout, especially if it’s a wall, and this can add realism to your scene if the conflict is strong. Arguments often begin with some distance between the characters, and a physical prop can help. Be aware though, that as the intensity creeps up, that barrier will probably be crossed. In this scene, he eventually moves into her room. You can experiment with barriers that completely separate the characters, giving them no view of each other, but you may find that having a window helps. They cannot see each other clearly, as the glass is mottled, but they can see each other’s position. This means they know where to direct their energies. Having a line of sight like this, even though it is distorted by the glass, makes it more powerful when one of them turns away from the other. For much of this scene she turns away from him in anger, increasing the conflict between them. The camera setup can be quite simple. In one room, try to capture the whole scene, so that we see him clearly, and see her indistinctly. The second camera should show only her, and should not look back into the room at him. To do so would draw too much of a connection between the characters when you are actually trying to separate them. The Reader. Directed by Stephen Daldry. The Weinstein Company, 2008.

1.6,Side Switch,"Capturing both actors in one frame enables you to see their body language and the way they interact physically in the scene. This can be exactly what you need for an argument or conflict. The disadvantage is that you frequently find yourself shooting the actors’ profiles, which limits how much we see of their faces. Body language is important, but to really know what characters are thinking and feeling we want to look in their eyes. If you want to show a medium shot like this, without cutting to close-ups, you have to find clever ways to move the camera and actors to show us more of their faces. This scene shows the two actors facing each other directly, so that most of their acting comes from their voices and body language. To get their faces in the shot, the director has them walk towards camera, and then dollies along the sidewalk with them. The key to this, however, is that the actors switch sides when they begin to walk away. This switch serves two purposes. First, it adds some visual interest and realism, because it looks more energetic than simply having the actors move off in a straight line. Second, it gives the director a chance to let each actor have a moment where he or she dominates the frame. When they first begin to walk, she is almost directly facing the camera, so we listen to her more intently. Then, as they catch up with the camera, he turns his face toward her, and he is the focus of the conversation. You may find that to get this to work you need the actor that’s closer to camera to walk slightly behind the other actor. It might not feel natural to the actors, but it looks real when filmed.

1.7,Snap Turn,"This shot gives a surprise impact, when a calm conversation suddenly turns into a conflict. The group of three characters walks along, and then as the argument ramps up, one character comes face to face with another, and they stop in their tracks. These two frame the third character. Although she is central in the frame, she remains an observer (rather than the focus of the scene) because the camera is at their head height, not hers. The moment where one actor runs forward and turns to face the other is actually quite unrealistic, and will feel so to the actor, but it looks convincing to the audience. The camera should move slightly slower than the actors. This enables the camera to come to a rest without it looking too sudden. The actors should, therefore, start a short distance away from the camera, and gradually catch up to it, finding their final marks as the camera stops. Although this looks simple, timing it exactly can take a lot of rehearsal, especially as the movement has to be dictated by the lines they are speaking, rather than where they happen to be standing. The snap turn is almost a reverse of the side switch, but it ends with the characters facing each other. As such, it creates a different effect, because the argument appears out of nowhere and surprises the audience (whereas with the side switch, the argument progresses into a conversation).

1.8,Swing To Cut,"An unexpected cut, during a scene filled with lots of motion, can have a startling effect. Used well, it can add impact to a quiet or calm line. In 21 Grams, the two characters move around the room as they argue. In the first frame you can see how the character closest to camera is moving in on the other. The camera arcs around to the left, as they move in to face each other. As soon as we have established that they are in a face-off, the camera cuts to close-up. Given all the handheld camera moves that have gone before, this is a surprise, and adds real weight to the moment where he whispers an important line. Often, it’s wise to avoid too many cuts during a conversation, as they prevent you seeing those important moments of change on an actor’s face. That is why Master Shots, Volume 2, shows you lots of ways to keep two or more faces on screen at the same time. In some cases, though, a quick, hard cut to a close-up is exactly what’s needed. The lenses used throughout this scene are short, to match the wide, handheld feel, but at this moment of rest, a long lens is used. This makes his face dominate the frame, so that most of the background vanishes. When you shoot this type of scene, make sure that your camera comes to rest in the opening, handheld shot. If it doesn’t, then cutting to a motionless camera will be too jarring for the audience. The camera doesn’t have to completely freeze, but it should settle as the two characters come together. 21 Grams. Directed by Alejandro Gonzãlez Iñárritu. Focus Features, 2003. All rights reserved."
1.9,Deep Staging,"Even when your characters end up fighting, as they do in this scene from Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, a lot can be gained by building the main conflict when the characters are at a distance from each other. This scene is a good example of deep staging, in that there is always something in the foreground, the midground, and the background. Although the viewer is watching the two men face up to each other, the setup gives this small room a much larger feel, making it seem more threatening. You may think that every shot automatically has a foreground, midground, and background, but many shots focus so intently on the subject — usually the main character — that they lack any depth or sense of space. Directors are especially guilty of neglecting this concept when shooting indoors, but as shown here, it is possible to give an indoor space this level of depth. By placing both cameras close to the wall, the director has his audience look out into the space of the room. Had the director shot from the middle of the room, this space would have looked quite conventional, and the depth of the space would have been lost. The cameras remain stationary, and the only movement is made by the deputy as he turns away from the wall and approaches the FBI agent, where the actual fight takes place. To shoot this sort of scene you only need to be aware of the importance of including foreground, midground, and background, and position your actors and cameras accordingly.

1.10,Power Struggle,"Conflict often leads to a direct power struggle, and that can be shown by one character ignoring another. In this scene from Defiance, Daniel Craig is trying to get the attention of the distant character, who largely ignores him. The positioning of the actor in relation to the camera is as important as the camera placement itself. In the first shot Craig’s body is turned off to the side, as if he is afraid to face up to the problem. Although he is facing the enemy, his body is turned more towards his friend and confidant who stands beside him. This body language contradicts his words, creating an interesting tension. The next shot gives the distant character some power, because he is filmed from behind, and acts as though none of this is of interest. His unwillingness to engage in the argument is shown by his body language; but rather than being afraid, he is showing that he is unperturbed. Importantly, the director uses a long lens for this shot, from behind Craig. This foreshortens the distance between them, which makes the distant character seem closer than he should be, as though he’s imposing his power on their space. Then, the director cuts to a wider shot that shows the whole scene, and this builds on everything that has gone before. The enemy is clearly surrounded by his friends, and remains disinterested in the conversation, only glancing around. Craig and his friend, meanwhile, are tiny in the frame, looking isolated in the snow. By making the main character appear afraid as he tries to regain power throughout this scene, the director creates far more tension than if the hero immediately acted like a hero. Shooting this sort of scene requires strong direction of the actors and careful placement of the camera. But it is relatively simple to shoot, because there are only a few shots and almost no camera movement. Defiance. Directed by Edward Zwick. Paramount Vantage, 2008. All rights reserved. CHAPTER 2 INCREASING TENSION"
2.1,Circling Dialogue,"Tension is often hidden underneath the surface, rather than being out in the open. You need to shoot in a way that makes it clear to the audience that a tension is present, while making it plausible that the characters are pretending all is well. This scene from Inglourious Basterds shows how the camera can circle two motionless characters, with both appearing calm, yet both knowing disaster looms. The move around them could be said to be a way of filling time, or just adding some visual interest to a dialogue-heavy scene, but it is much more than that. By leaving them in place, the director emphasizes that they are almost motionless, talking politely, almost in whispers. The move also means there is a brief moment where the viewer looks almost directly into one of the character’s eyes. His fear is evident, even though he is trying to hide it. This shows the audience that the other character can probably also sense his fear, and it is thus a subtle plot revelation. A move such as this also emphasizes that the two characters are located in opposition and focused on each other. No matter how casually they are playing it, they are extremely intent on each other’s words. To shoot this type of move, it helps if you have a dolly on curved rails, although it can (as with all the shots in this book) be done handheld. If you simply move around the table, the characters will get closer to the camera halfway through and this can weaken the overall effect. The trick is to keep the camera at the same distance from the characters throughout, by moving around them in a smooth arc. Inglourious Basterds. Directed by Quentin Tarantino.

2.2,Closing Space,"This scene from Munich shows how it’s possible to raise the tension, while also showing people opening up to the possibility of trust. There are times when using these contrasting ideas and emotions can give a scene huge impact. It plays much more deeply than if they were simply mistrusting, or if they were merely listening. It’s the contrast that makes for tension, and makes us hang on their every word. First, this is set in an interesting space, with one character physically much higher than the other. During the course of the scene, he comes down to the level of the second character. At the same time, the second character moves closer. They are literally and figuratively crossing a huge divide. To exaggerate and emphasize this feeling, the director films the opening shots with wide lenses. As the actors get closer, longer lenses are used. When they are at their closest, the longest lenses of all are used. At each cut, this lens choice enhances their movement toward each other. If you watch the film you’ll see that the scene opens with an even wider lens, showing both of them from above, to firmly establish their separation. To look at these frame grabs, you could say that this is a traditional angle/reverse angle scene, but the small changes made in terms of height, distance, and the choice of lens turn it into drama.

2.3,Exaggerated Height,"When you want to show one character frightening another, the most obvious techniques can be effective. Placing the more powerful character up high and having him look down at the victim works well. A brief establishing shot shows that he is trying to get her to raise her hands so he can inspect them. The director then cuts to two shots of their faces. The shot of him is taken from halfway down her body, so that the viewer looks up at an extremely exaggerated angle. The director also shows her reaction to him, even though it is side-on and out of focus. If the camera was further back, or at her head height, the sense of his domination would be diminished. The shot from his point of view is made from shoulder height. It focuses on her face and her reaction, rather than his. The viewer identifies with her because the shots reveal her perception of the situation more than his. In this scene, they both repeatedly look at her hands and then at each other. This adds some interest, movement, and variety to the setup, which otherwise might seem stationary. Shots like this should not be over-used, because they can quickly become ridiculous. They must be justified by the plot or the needs of the scene. Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me. Directed by David Lynch. New Line Cinema, 1992. All rights reserved."
2.4,Dramatic Swing,"When tension is increasing it can be made all the more unbearable when one character remains calm. This is seen quite often, especially when worried civilians are being interviewed by near-bored cops, as in The Lovely Bones. In scenes like this, cutting between the two characters in the standard way could break the tension. To preserve the tension, keep the focus on one character before turning around to show the other. This shot opens with the cop framed on the left, and only the back of her head in shot. The audience is aware that she’s in the scene, but they don’t get to see her face, and the camera moves away from her. Both voices are audible as the camera pushes forward, and as it passes his shoulder, it finally turns around to look at her. The viewer then sees her stress, because the discomforting sensation has been established. This move works well when you’re trying to show miscommunication, or one character not listening to another. The trick is to focus on a secondary or incidental character at the start of the shot, with the main character’s face out of shot. This makes the audience uncomfortable, because they want to see the main character, they want to know how she is coping with the situation. They expect a quick cut to her reaction, but when the camera pushes forward, closer to him, it captures some of the tension she is feeling. It’s worth noting that there’s another cop in the background, while behind her there is only an image of the home. This small attention to detail adds to the feeling that there is a strange world on one side, intruding on the home. The Lovely Bones. Directed by Peter Jackson. DreamWorks SKG, 2009. All rights reserved."
2.5,Clandestine,"When your characters need to have a secret conversation, without it looking like they’re talking at all, you can achieve the best effect with motionless cameras and limited views of the actors. The scene shown here has one camera set up to establish the geography of the scene. It shows the wide, open space of the gallery, and the actors move into the space without looking at each other. They talk to each other without making eye contact. The most they do is angle their heads slightly toward each other. This is primarily so that the cameras set up behind them can see their faces. If they looked directly ahead throughout the whole scene, the viewer wouldn’t get to see their faces at all. To get this setup to work, you do need to show the actors’ faces, but be wary of an actor who tries to angle his face toward the camera more than you want. Most actors will respect the needs of the scene, but one may find it difficult to act with his back to the camera, and will continually turn his head so that it’s in shot. Remind your actor that the purpose of the scene is for him to remain covert as the talk continues. The establishing shot can be done with quite a wide lens, but the other shots should use a long lens. This throws the foreground (the other actor’s shoulder) and the background out of focus, which isolates each character within the scene. You may need to set up your camera well away from the actors, or you will get an unintentional close-up, with an actor’s head filling the frame. Although there isn’t much movement in a scene like this, you want to leave some space around the actors’ heads to keep some awareness of the space they are sitting in. If your viewer forgets about their location the need for secrecy is lost, so get far enough back to show their surroundings, even when using a long lens. The International. Directed by Tom Tykwer. Columbia Pictures, 2009. All rights reserved."
2.6,Frame Share,"In the standard dialogue setup, you cut from one character on the left of the frame to a character on the right of the frame. You can add tension to a scene by setting it up so that both characters are on the same side of the frame. These shots from The Majestic show how both characters are looking at each other, but both are on the left-hand side of the frame. This is unusual, and makes the audience feel uneasy. In this scene, one character is seated and the camera remains at his head height throughout because he is the main character. This could work just as well if both were seated, or if both were standing. The danger here is that, because your audience expects to see one character frame-left and the other frame-right, breaking the rule can disorient them. This is, of course, what you want to some degree, but you don’t want them to be confused about where people are, or who’s looking at whom. The trick is to start with a reasonably wide shot, as shown here, which makes it clear where the main character is sitting in the room, and what direction he’s looking in. Ideally, you should make the first cut when he’s looking directly at the other character. The second character can then be shown in a medium shot, and it will be clear where everybody is, even though they are sharing the same part of the frame. You can move in closer on the main character, as the director does here by filming Jim Carrey in a medium-close shot, while the other character remains more distant. The uncomfortable feeling is created without confusion. The Majestic. Directed by Frank Darabont. Warner Bros., 2001. All rights reserved."
2.7,Focus On One,"When a conversation turns from gentle argument to something more intense, moving in on one character can be a way of indicating the rising pressure. In this single-shot from Magnolia, the camera slowly pushes in on the two characters as they talk, and as it gets closer it slowly moves over to the main character until it is looking up at him. This works because they are both sitting at the bar and are thus facing the camera. It could work just as well if they were sitting on a park bench, but you need to find a plausible reason to have people sit next to each other as the conversation progresses. At times, you can direct the actors to look at each other, but these only need to be glances. They can spend most of their time, as real people do, looking forward. This keeps them facing toward the camera, so your audience can take in their expressions. You need to start a shot such as this from quite a distance away, but the characters will be too small in the frame unless you use a reasonably long lens. The challenge with a longer lens is that it’s more difficult to stay in focus as you push in, so you’ll need the dolly move to be slow and smooth. When you come to rest on the main character, the conversation can continue, and the words of the off-screen character remain audible for a while. Don’t keep this going for too long, though. You need to end the scene, or cut to a different angle. Magnolia. Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. New Line Cinema, 1999. All rights reserved."
2.8,Level Change,"Camera height is one of the most neglected tools in a filmmaker’s arsenal. Positioning actors at different heights, and putting your camera at different levels, can have profound effects on the scene. One of the most interesting ways to increase tension in a scene is to put the more frightening character low down, while putting a nervous hero high up. You can see the tension and fear created by this technique in Inglourious Basterds, where the director puts the female character above the man she’s frightened of. They continue a relatively mundane conversation, but it is their positioning in relation to each other, and the fact that they shake hands while on these different levels, that makes it transfixing. Although he is seated, the camera is at his level at all times when filming him or when turned on her. This is his first scene in the film, and she is well established as a main character, so by tying the camera to his level the director gives him a strong sense of power. He’s taking us away from our viewpoint character. The audience would prefer to be at her eye level, looking down on him, but by being dragged to his level, the viewer feels her fear. Finally, she is made to sit near him, and is brought down to his level. This gives the audience the sensation of her being pulled into his world against her will. The final shot, where she takes her seat, is also unnerving, because she is further to the left of frame than normal (for a character who is looking to screen left). This leaves a space on the right of the screen, which unbalances the audience even further. Inglourious Basterds. Directed by Quentin Tarantino. Universal Pictures, 2009. All rights reserved."
2.9,Claustrophobic Space,"When dramatic or tragic news is revealed to a character, it helps to get close to him to show every nuance of the actor’s performance. This can be enhanced by using a long lens, and the actor’s position in the frame, to box him in. This creates a sense of claustrophobia that is often experienced by those hearing unbearable news. To take this even further, the director may slightly disorient the audience by cutting to an unusual angle. In the frames shown here, Naomi Watts is filmed with a long lens. It’s an over-the-shoulder shot, but the lens is so long that the foreground character is extremely blurred and the background almost non- existent, so the audience is watching her expression alone. The camera is positioned so that the audience looks almost straight into her eyes and identifies with her. When the second doctor starts talking, she looks to frame right (her left), but at first the audience doesn’t see him. After a while, the director cuts to a shot showing the doctor. Unusually, this is shot from her left-hand side, breaking the standard rules of where the camera should go. The first shot was taken from her right-hand side, so cutting to a shot from her left crosses the line of action (an imaginary line between the two characters who are talking). If used carelessly this cut will confuse the audience, but because she has turned her head and moved her eyes to the left, the director makes it very clear where everybody is. To maintain the sense of claustrophobia, the director sets this doctor quite close to camera (although not as close as her), and tightly frames him with Watts on one side and another character on the left. They push into the frame much more than usual, which makes this shot feel extremely crowded. You will create the best effect if you use people to build this sense of claustrophobia, as shown here. If you use other foreground objects, rather than people, the crowding of the frame doesn’t have as strong an effect. 21 Grams. Directed by Alejandro Gonzãlez Iñárritu. Focus Features, 2003. All rights reserved."
2.10,Track Character,"As tensions reach boiling point, characters often blurt out their fears. When filmed well, these scenes are compelling, but you need to capture the energy and confusion of the main character. You can see that as Natalie Portman moves toward the camera, the camera moves continually to the left, panning to the right to keep her in shot as she walks straight forward. When she turns to her right (moving to screen left), the camera continues to move, keeping her in shot. The camera’s actual move to the left is quite small, but because she moves straight forward and then turns, this creates a lot of confusing movement. This is made even more dramatic because the scene is shot from behind an obstruction. It’s not clear whether these are pillars, bedposts, or something else, but they serve the purpose of making her seem imprisoned in a confusing world. The shot of the two listeners is filmed with a stationary camera to reflect the fact that they are dealing with the situation more calmly. The problem here is that cutting from the moving shot to the still shot is quite jarring. One solution is to shoot a close-up of the main character’s face, so you can jump cut to it as a transition between shots. Alternatively, you could stay on her (without showing the other characters), until she is facing them. This technique can be applied in many ways, and you don’t necessarily need the foreground obstructions to get it to work. The most important thing is to have the main character move roughly toward camera, as it moves away from her, while panning to keep her in shot, and then have her track across to catch up with the camera. A long lens makes her movement forward seem nightmarishly slow, but then makes her move to the left seem swift, adding to the confused, dreamlike feeling of the scene. The Other Boleyn Girl. Directed by Justin Chadwick. Columbia Pictures/Focus Features, 2008. All rights reserved. CHAPTER THREE POWER STRUGGLES"
3.1,Disoriented,"During any power struggle, there is often a moment of change, where one character gains the upper hand. Far from being a moment of relief, this is often a new challenge for the character and one that leaves him feeling disoriented. A camera move can be used to bring up this feeling of being overwhelmed. At the moment that Chris Pine takes the captain’s chair in Star Trek, the director wants to show the magnitude of this moment for him, no matter what he actually says, or what is said to him. To achieve this, the director positions the camera so that the chair is central in the frame. Then, as the camera moves forward it moves to the side and rolls over. This gives the scene a slightly drunken feeling, and leaves a space in the frame for Zoe Saldana to enter the left of the frame. Even though the viewer hasn’t seen her approach, he feels as if she’s been drawn in by the camera move. Her dialogue at this moment may further disturb Pine’s sense of self, or ground him back in reality, depending on the type of scene being shot. Shots like this, where the camera is given a “Dutch angle,” work best when they are used rarely. If you use lots of Dutch angles, they won’t have much effect. They also work well when they come during a camera move, rather than with a straight cut. Although you can run dialogue through the entire scene, you will probably find it best to wait until the end, when the second character moves into the frame. By doing this, you give the moment of change all the weight it requires, before you move back to dialogue. Star Trek. Directed by J. J. Abrams. Paramount Pictures, 2009. All rights reserved."
3.2,Doorway Angles,"Doorways are interesting places to hold conversations, and they are often the scene of power struggles, because one person wants something and the other resists. In this scene from Ghost World, Steve Buscemi is doing his best to get information out of Scarlett Johansson, but she isn’t interested. Attention to lens choice and camera placement are essential in portraying this power struggle effectively. Although he is not a hostile character, Buscemi’s arrival is meant to feel like an intrusion. This is shown partly by the way she holds the door, as though ready to slam it in his face. The shot of her is quite close, with a long lens. This has the effect of making him seem closer to her, and closer to the threshold of her home, than he actually is. It also cuts out the doorway itself, which makes it seem as though he’s already in the home. This is a subtle psychological trick. In the reverse angle, the director has shot with a wider lens, from further back. This means that we can see the door and both characters. The door itself appears ready to move, something the audience notices. When shooting a power struggle in a doorway, you may shoot a lot of coverage, using different lenses and distances on each actor. But when you cut, restricting yourself to two angles and lenses (as shown here) can be all you need to show the power imbalance between them. Ghost World. Directed by Terry Zwigoff. United Artists, 2001. All rights reserved."
3.3,Angle Exchange,"At first glance, this may look like the standard angle/reverse angle setup, but there’s more to it than that. At a key moment, when the power finally shifts between these two characters, he walks away. By the time he’s come to rest, the camera places him on the right of frame, where she was. This shows that a power shift has just taken place. Without the move, this crucial scene would be just a series of angle/reverse angle shots, and its impact would be lost. By putting in the move, the change is made both overtly and on a subconscious level. This makes it a powerful move, even though it’s fairly easy to set up. The first setup is a classic angle/reverse angle, so that she’s on the right of the frame, and he’s on the left. At the moment that he walks away from her, the camera cuts to a wider shot. He walks to his left (the right of frame). At the same time, she crosses the screen behind him to the left of frame. Without this movement — where they both cross the screen — the geography of the scene would confuse the viewer. This wider shot is also essential because it actually shows them swapping sides of the frame, illustrating the power shift. The final shot is again set up in classic angle/reverse angle, but now the characters have switched sides, and he is on the right of the screen. You might be wondering if it really matters whether somebody is on the right or the left of screen. There’s a lot of theory about which side you should put the hero on, but few people agree on which side is which. What’s important is that you echo moments of change by changing the character’s position in the frame. Almost Famous. Directed by Cameron Crowe. Columbia Pictures, 2000. All rights reserved."
3.4,Threshold,"A power struggle that takes place in secret is extremely dramatic. Equally, the best secrets are hidden in plain sight. These shots from The Other Boleyn Girl illustrate a silhouetted shooting style to reflect the clandestine nature of the struggle. Most importantly, the actors are placed on a boundary between the inside and the outside to create a sense of unease. The characters are at odds with each other, but rather than having an all-out argument, they are forced to struggle for power over each other. Their argument must remain secret (for plot reasons) and they are always visible to others (for plot reasons), so they speak in whispers, without dramatic movement. The director could have filmed them standing in any space, but he placed them on a threshold between inside and outside to create some uncertainty and unease. The characters aren’t really anywhere, because they are neither inside nor outside. The strong light from outside throws them into silhouette, which adds interest to shots that might otherwise be dampened by their stillness. The audience must listen to and care about every word, so by playing out the scene on this border between spaces, the director makes his audience eager to discover what is going on between them. Secret conversations are more exciting when they are held within earshot of those who must never hear them, and if your script contains such a scene, putting your characters on a border between spaces will create the tension you want your audience to feel. The Other Boleyn Girl. Directed by Justin Chadwick. Columbia Pictures/Focus Features, 2008. All rights reserved."
3.5,Space Reverse,"People locked in a power struggle aren’t usually together by choice, but by necessity. Often a dangerous environment or situation throws them together against their will, and the audience sees them forced to confront one another. It is rare for real power struggles to occur while characters are on the move. Even in the midst of battle, they will usually settle their score when standing at rest. Often, they will stop at a threshold or barrier, facing an obstacle that must be overcome. This tips them over the edge, and makes them challenge each other. When you come to one of these scenes, you can make good use of the space surrounding the actors to emphasize that outside forces have pushed them together. To make the most of these moments, put the camera on one side of this barrier, and then the other, while the characters remain stuck in the same place, working their way through their argument. These shots from Terminator Salvation show the characters stopped at the edge of a dangerous area. There’s no doubt that this is a barrier to the characters, because there are warning signs and barbed wire. The director places the camera quite low, and the characters are looking down, apprehensively, into the space ahead of them. Once they are talking, the scene cuts to a shot from behind the characters, and we can see the unpleasant land beyond that they are unwilling to face. At the moment the camera turns, she also turns to face him, so that we can see her face as they talk. He angles his body around slightly, so that he isn’t completely turned away from camera. If you shoot this type of scene, you don’t need a physical barrier, but it helps. The warning sign used in these shots stays in the center of the screen in both angles, marking the barrier that they can’t cross, and also putting something physical between the two characters to emphasize their separation from each other. Terminator Salvation. Directed by Joseph McGinty Nichol. Warner Bros., 2009. All rights reserved."
3.6,Character Chase,"You can create a lot of energy in a scene where one character is keen to talk and the other is less interested. This creates the feeling that one character is trying to chase the other. The script will usually dictate this sort of scene, but it’s a technique that can be applied cinematically to many scenes with startling results. It can be a useful way to get the actors to move beyond an obvious interpretation. The camera setup can be extremely simple, with the main idea being that you follow the character that’s being pursued. By doing this, you give the audience the sensation of chasing that character, which echoes what the second character is doing. The chase here is subtle and suggested, of course, and is more about one character trying to get the other’s attention, rather than an actual chase. As such, the physical movements don’t need to be larger than a walk across the room. In this example, the character played by Malcolm McDowell moves around the room, and the other character follows with a slight time lag. This slight delay is important, because it makes it look like the second character is catching up. You can shoot this with a single camera, which moves forward and pans to follow the action, or you can cut to a second camera. Whichever you choose, position the second character out-of-frame briefly. This means that he has to re-enter the frame at some point, which again emphasizes the idea that he is catching up.

3.7,Side On,"When a character loses power, you can reveal the intensity of his loss by shooting from the side as he makes a final speech. Although you will spend much of your directing time finding ways to show the characters’ faces from the front, this is a time when shooting in profile works. It makes the character, who was formerly powerful, seem cowed and submissive. There are many ways to shoot a character from the side, but this example from Star Trek achieves several different effects at once. By shooting with a long lens, the director focuses tightly on the central character, isolating him from the scene behind him. When he moves away, the long lens causes him to exit the frame almost instantly. The director then racks focus to the background characters to show their reaction. Actors enjoy scenes such as these, when they get to make a dramatic speech, and most of their best work occurs during moments of change. Unfortunately, the traditional cutting pattern can lead to every moment of change being missed, as the director cuts from one speaker to the next. A shot like this ensures the director doesn’t miss any of the actor’s work, and there is no need to cut away from this close shot. When the moment is complete, you will need to cut to a wider shot when the other characters move away from their marks. The only person your audience should see walking out of this close shot is the main character. If you show other people walking out of this frame, you take away some of the emotional impact of the hero’s exit. Star Trek. Directed by J. J. Abrams. Paramount Pictures, 2009. All rights reserved. CHAPTER 4 GROUP CONVERSATION"
4.1,Angle Anchor,"When you’re shooting a scene with a lot of people, one approach you can choose is to set up lots of cameras and get endless coverage. This will work, because it will give you plenty to edit with. You should make sure, however, that you don’t just get one establishing shot and a medium close-up of each person. If you do, you run the risk of a boring scene or, worse, confusing geography, so the audience doesn’t know who’s looking at whom. This can be especially problematic if the scene has been running for a while and you then cut to a character who hasn’t spoken. If you haven’t established where that character is, you need to do so. In this scene, Matt Damon has not spoken, and although he’s been visible in the background, the audience won’t be completely clear about where he is standing. When he does speak, he could be talking to anybody in the room. The director cuts to a reverse angle, just to the left of Damon’s point of view. The characters are arranged in a way that forces them to move in order to see him speak. George Clooney makes direct eye contact, but the other characters (who are closer to camera) have to make a fuss of twisting around to see him. This fixes Damon’s position in the scene. If the director had cut straight to a medium shot of Clooney, the audience would know that the two were talking, but would have no sense of where everybody stood in the room. By setting it up in this way, the director reveals the reactions of many people, without confusing the geography, while maintaining direct eye contact between the two who are talking. When shooting large groups, arrange your actors so that they have to move or shuffle around to see each other speak. This staging gives far more depth to a scene, and makes the audience sense they are watching a room where something is happening, rather than a room where a lot of actors are talking. Ocean’s Eleven. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. Warner Bros., 2001. All rights reserved."
4.2,Eyeline Anchor,"This scene from Ocean’s Eleven is used again here because the director is faced with the challenge of showing a group conversation with more than ten people. Everybody who’s in the scene counts, and they all have something to say. The audience needs to know where everybody is, who’s sitting where, and what they’re all thinking about. To do this, the audience needs to see that they are all listening to the main character, played by George Clooney. The shot of Clooney shows him standing against a wall, looking out at the room. He could be looking at any one of the other characters that traipses into the room. In scenes such as this, there are times when you’ll need to indicate exactly who’s talking to whom (as with angle anchor in the previous section). But at other times, you would simply want to keep Clooney as the focus and make it clear how the scene is set up, so that the audience can follow the conversation. Clooney looks out in one direction, and everybody else is looking at him. Their eyelines give away exactly where they are in the room. In some cases, their faces are toward the camera, but their eyes are strongly angled to the side, to emphasize the direction of the eyeline. In another shot, the director emphasizes the eyeline by shooting low and having two people look up in the same direction, their heads angled almost identically. The positioning of these actors’ bodies and eyes is not casual. The director has positioned them this way for the precise purpose of showing that they are listening to Clooney. You can move your camera in a scene such as this, but it can quickly become confusing when you start to cut. You solve this by gathering lots of coverage, from many angles, but also by positioning the actors — and directing their eyes — so that every shot leaves no doubt about who’s sitting where, and who they are listening to. Only when the scene is as clear as this will the audience be able to concentrate on the (relatively complicated) dialogue. Ocean’s Eleven. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. Warner Bros., 2001. All rights reserved."
4.3,Group Pivot,"You can shoot a group of three people in one move, without cuts, and still keep everybody in shot. Although there is nothing wrong with cutting during a scene, you may notice that this book stresses the value of scenes with no cuts. Cutting can, of course, give you more control over which performance you use. On the other hand, when you shoot the scene in one move, the actors will rise to the occasion, and your audience is drawn into the world more effectively than when there are lots of cuts. This is most important when you want them to listen to the dialogue. This scene from Munich shows the characters arranged around a table, with a big space on the camera side. By pushing in at an angle, the director shows the relation of Eric Bana to the other two. As the camera gets closer, he leans forward so that the three of them remain in shot. Then, as the camera comes to the end of its move, it pans left to face the other two actors. Although all three actors talk throughout the scene, this move shifts the focus from what he is saying to how they are reacting to his words. From this point, you might cut to traditional coverage or end the scene. For scenes such as this to work, you will have to ask your actors to lean into frame at the appropriate moment. You can see in these stills that they are positioning their bodies, most of the time, to suit the framing. Some actors will find this more challenging than others, but try to let them know that their body positioning is a detail they can use to improve their performance. If you tell an actor to lean in, it is because you want him to appear aggressive, or curious. Describe to your actors how the camera moves and blocking make sense on a performance level, and they will be far more willing to handle the technical side for you. Munich. Directed by Steven Spielberg. DreamWorks SKG, 2005. All rights reserved."
4.4,Central Character,"Even when your group of characters is quite small, somebody can be left out of the conversation. If this is your main character, rather than pushing him to the side, place him right in the middle of the frame. The exact effect you create will depend on the characters and story, but in general this positioning creates a sense of unease in the central character. Here, Zach Braff is sharing the same piece of furniture with the other two and is clearly uncomfortable. A lot of this discomfort is communicated by directorial choices, such as having the other male actor’s shirt off, having him smoke, having Braff lower his head slightly. These all contribute, but the positioning of the camera is also vital. The wide shot, which shows all three characters, is shot from their head height, looking straight at them. The main character is framed centrally, so the viewer notices him, even though he is the least talkative and offers the least visual interest. The other two shots frame the characters to the far right and far left of frame, respectively. This pushes them up against Braff, even when he isn’t visible. They are pushed against the edge of the frame where the viewer knows he is sitting. This sustains the crushed, uncomfortable feeling throughout the scene. Although you may spend a lot of your time trying to stop the actors looking straight at each other, this is one setup where the actors on either side of Braff should talk directly to each other. If they don’t, then their body language becomes too casual and makes the arrangement feel as though everybody is included. By having these two look at each other, but not at the main character, the director causes his audience to sense Braff’s feeling of exclusion. Garden State. Directed by Zach Braff. Fox Searchlight, 2004. All rights reserved."
4.5,Along The Line,"When you have three or four people in a scene, how do you keep them all visible without endless cuts? One way is to put them all in a line and orient them so that their faces are visible for most of the scene. If all three characters in this scene were facing the bar, the effect would not work, so the character closest to camera has her back to the bar. This is justified by having her carry a tray of drinks. It’s important to have this kind of justification, partly so that your actor feels comfortable, and to prevent this shot from looking like a forced setup. If she stared at the two men throughout this scene, you would have to keep cutting to a reverse angle of her. This is why, early in the scene, the director has her turn her head toward camera and motion to the dance floor. Again, there is a strong reason for her to do this, in terms of the plot, as there should be. Although the director did shoot a reverse angle, and uses it a couple of times, he keeps its use to a minimum with this wider master shot. By reducing the cuts, the director gives the scene a good rhythm and the audience listens to what is being said. By shooting the two men together, who are turning around to listen to her, the director can jump cut straight from the wide shot to the medium close-up of the two of them. This is less jarring than if everybody has a close-up and the director is forced to cut, cut, cut from one person to the next. North Country. Directed by Niki Caro. Warner Bros., 2005. All rights reserved."
4.6,Line Of Three,"When you want all your actors to focus on something external, position them so that they are all in the frame as the scene plays out. Stand them in a line, at a slight angle to the camera, and have each one look into the distance. This works well if they are standing on the edge of something, such as a balcony, or, as shown here, standing at the railing of a ship. One danger with this is that if each actor moves into position one after the other, it looks comical. To avoid this, have the central character move in first, as Keira Knightley does here. Then move in the character that’s closest to camera. The most distant character can come in last, after some dialogue has been exchanged. This is meant to be an exciting moment in the film, but the camera doesn’t move, so the director makes great use of the characters’ eyes and head-angles to bring more energy to the scene. At first, all of them are looking off into the distance. Then, the director racks focus to the closest character and Knightley looks directly at him as he speaks. (In reality, she probably wouldn’t do this, as she can’t see his eyes, but it looks good on screen.) Finally, as Orlando Bloom speaks, the focus is on him, and the closest character turns to look at him. Importantly, Knightley continues to keep her face toward the camera. This is because Bloom is quite distant from the camera and his face is small in the frame; if the others both turned around to face him, the shot would appear empty and would lose a lot of its impact.

4.7,Central Line,"In many group conversations, most of the action takes place between two main characters. There may be others sitting around with them, but it’s the dialogue between these two that matters most. In such scenes you can use the standard angle/reverse angle approach to great effect. Rather than going in close, you can shoot from outside the group. This keeps everybody in view, so that when the characters on either side do interject, we can see and hear them. The illustrations show how to position your camera on one side of an imaginary line drawn between the two main characters. This is an exceptionally simple setup, and requires no movement, close-ups, or other coverage. It works because you have four people and they are in a busy environment. Cutting can be problematic, because your actors will need to make sure they time their physical movements from take to take to avoid continuity errors. You could shoot some close-ups to provide coverage to get past such errors, but this setup works best when it uses just the two angles. In Revolutionary Road, this setup is successful because the director used it in an early scene and then returned to it much later in the film, when many things have changed. By using identical angles and only slightly changing the characters’ costuming, the director gives his audience the feeling that the more things change, the more they stay the same. If he had shot the scene with lots of motion and multiple angles, this effect would have been impossible to achieve. Revolutionary Road. Directed by Sam Mendes. Paramount Vantage, 2008.

4.8,Solid Camera,"Sometimes, the last thing you need is a camera move. In this scene from Grease, Jeff Conaway barely moves and the camera doesn’t move at all. The other characters move all around him, further emphasizing his solidity in this scene. A setup like this will only work if you have a character who is very cool, strong, or certain in some way, surrounded by others who are either excited (as here), in a panic, or under pressure. With the camera so still, and the main character doing nothing more than turning his head, it’s important that you add visual interest to the scene. In this scene, the director placed the camera a long way back and used a long lens. This makes the distant background appear closer and blurred, again focusing the audience on this small crowd, rather than anything else. The other characters move, partly for the sake of visual interest, but also to turn their faces to camera. By looking at each other, as well as at him, they display more facial expressions to the audience. Finally, one of the characters turns his back on the camera, ready to rush past Conaway and out of this setup. When you’ve set up such a solid scene, you need to break out of it strongly, or the next cut will feel jarring. By having a character come toward the screen or turn his back on the camera (as shown here), you get that strong effect. Grease. Directed by Randal Kleiser. Paramount Pictures, 1978. All rights reserved."
4.9,Round Table,"Shooting a large group of people talking around a table can be a huge challenge. It’s especially demanding in scenes where the audience needs to know who’s talking to whom. Sometimes, the conversation is general, and it’s not so important, but in a scene such as this, the audience must know that Brad Pitt is the one who’s meant to be the focus of the scene. The fact that he is Brad Pitt does a lot of the work for us, but the director is not so lazy as to rely on this. When the scene opens there is a brief establishing shot, which shows where everybody is sitting in relation to everybody else. The main character, played by Pitt, is the most strongly lit, and moves the most, leaning into frame, so that the viewer spots him and remembers where he is in the room. The next shot has him on frame right, looking to frame left. The other characters are in shot, to his left, but the one delivering dialogue is facing away from the camera. This keeps the audience focus strongly on Pitt. The director then cuts to a similar shot, from a similar camera position, but this time Pitt is placed on frame left and is looking to frame right. It is not just his positioning in the frame, but the way he angles his body and eyes that helps to cement in the viewer’s mind where he is sitting, and how this group is arranged around him. After showing this much of a similar scene, you could easily switch to shots such as close-ups, so long as you keep coming back to these two shots to keep the geography of the scene clear. Ocean’s Eleven. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. Warner Bros., 2001. All rights reserved."
4.10,Expanding Group,"Directors tend to see group dialogue as a problem, or at least a challenge. The best directors see it as a great opportunity to expand the story and reveal character. With real skill, it’s possible to do all this without ever making a single cut. This scene from Munich starts with a close-up on Eric Bana, with the conversation taking place behind him. What the audience sees on his face is as important as what’s being said back there, so it doesn’t matter that the background is out of focus. The camera moves back slowly on a dolly, and as it does, people from the background move forward into the frame. Rather than cutting to them, or having him turn to them, the director has the characters walk right up to him and lean into frame. They move back to the background and continue this dance until they are on both sides of him as the camera reaches its final position. As the director, you could end the scene at this point or cut to a different angle. If you cut to a motionless camera, make sure this camera has stopped before doing so. If you cut to another moving camera, do so while this camera is still moving. It could be argued that this setup is far from naturalistic, when looking at the still-frame grabs, but in the context of the film, this scene works. The audience is intent on Bana’s reaction, seeing the effect the surrounding drama has on him. If you plan to use a single moving shot to capture an entire scene, make sure your main character is the true focus of the scene and the absolute focus of the other characters in the scene. If they are genuinely intent on getting something out of the main character — a reaction, a comment — then their positioning in the frame is believable. Munich. Directed by Steven Spielberg. Universal Studios, 2005. All rights reserved. CHAPTER 5 CONNECTING CHARACTERS"
5.1,Long Lens Space,"When two characters meet for the first time, you need to make the most of the moment. A good screenwriter will often keep the dialogue minimal at this point, so you need to use all the visual skills in your arsenal to connect these characters. Long lenses have a way of showing distance and proximity at the same time, which is perfect for a dialogue scene where two characters first meet. In these shots from Paris, je t’aime, Natalie Portman is a long way from the camera, but the long lens brings her closer. When she walks toward the camera, the long lens makes her movement forward almost imperceptible, so that crossing the long space of this hallway takes her a long time. This is a perfect way for the director to show that, although there is a growing connection between these two characters, finalizing that connection takes some effort on their part. The reverse shot of him uses a slightly shorter lens and he appears low-down in the window frame, giving him an air of vulnerability. The choice of location is as important as the lens choice and camera position. If the director had simply walked her across a room, the effect would not have been as strong. Instead, she crosses a room (from the very farthest wall), then moves all the way down a long hallway. This tunneling effect suggests that she is traveling toward him, rather than just coming over to talk to somebody. You can see how the director took advantage of her moving into the light at the end of the shot. When she is close to the camera, she becomes illuminated by the window light. Although the character she’s talking to is blind in this story (and cannot see this illumination), the effect on the audience is to show her radiance as the connection between them is made. Paris, je t’aime (segment titled Faubourg Saint-Denis). Directed by Tom Tykwer. Victoires International, 2006. All rights reserved."
5.2,Obstruction,"In many of these chapters you’ll notice that when we’re trying to connect characters, they are often held apart. Writers tease the audience by keeping lovers apart for as long as possible, and directors echo this by finding visual ways to keep the characters away from each other. In Onegin, the director puts a physical barrier — a bookcase — between the characters. The size of the barrier is made completely clear by shooting from a good distance back, so that the viewer sees the bookcase towering above the two characters. Despite this barrier, the characters continue to converse. Then, when least expected, the director cuts to a shot of Liv Tyler, filmed through the bookcase. This is a pleasant surprise, because it shows that the two can in fact see each other and a connection is forming between them. This second shot uses a long lens to make the bookcase seem blurred and to foreshorten the distance, so that she seems closer than she actually is. Don’t underestimate the power of these symbolic barriers. It’s easy to dismiss them as film theory, but these techniques can enrich your film greatly. Although the audience won’t consciously notice what you’re doing, putting barriers between characters and then opening them up will have an effect on how your viewers experience the scene. Onegin.

5.3,Facing Away,"This iconic shot from Nineteen Eighty-Four shows that turning actors away from the camera can work beautifully during an important dialogue scene. The actors do glance at each other and turn to look at one another in profile, but for most of the scene they are looking out at the scenery. The setup for a shot like this is extremely simple in terms of positioning the camera at head height, a short distance from the actors. To get the most out of it, though, the director has made sure that the viewer sees a foreground, a midground, and a background. This is a principle that can be used to increase the beauty of any shot, but is especially important when there is little movement, or when faces are concealed. In this shot, the actors are in the midground. The background is the distinctive landscape, and the foreground is made up of branches and leaves. There are strong plot reasons for the foreground and background to be visible. The background is part of a dream, and the foreground branches show that they are on the edge of the woodland we saw them in earlier. It could be argued that the director is simply showing the audience what they need to see to make sense of the film. Although this could be true, really strong and memorable images often make use of a strong foreground, midground, and background, and you can experiment with them, even when they aren’t particularly relevant to the plot. When, though, do you turn your characters away from the camera? This isn’t something you should do often. It should only happen when what they look at is important to them, and when their dialogue is something that the audience can understand without seeing their expressions. For scenes where these criteria are met, this setup has much potential and forms a strong on-screen bond between two characters. Nineteen Eighty-Four. Directed by Michael Radford. Umbrella-Rosenblum Films Production, 1984. All rights reserved."
5.4,Angled Push,"Even the best directors resort to using the angle/reverse angle approach from time to time, but when they do, they often give it a small twist. In this scene from The Lovely Bones, the smallest of camera moves makes an ordinary setup into something dramatic. The camera starts in medium close-up on each character, but as they talk, it pushes in closer. It does this at the same speed for each character, so that as the director cuts between them, each face is the same size as the other in the frame. This draws a connection between the two of them. If the camera moved in on one character but not on the other, it would draw attention to the first character. By moving in on both, the camera draws them together. It helps if the actors are almost motionless in a scene like this, and facing each other directly. People rarely face each other directly, which is why you have to be cautious about positioning them in this way. In this example, they are both focusing on the ship-in-a-bottle that he’s working on, which gives a justification for their seating position. If you can’t use a prop, you should only use this approach when there is good reason for one person to directly face another, such as a teacher addressing a student. The move itself should be slow and weighted so that the audience isn’t aware that it’s happening. Set up your camera so that you can keep the actors’ eyes at the same level in the frame, without having to tilt or raise the camera as you push in. The Lovely Bones. Directed by Peter Jackson. Paramount Pictures, 2009. All rights reserved."
5.5,Back To Character,"The strongest connections between characters can occur when one person is trying to avoid the other. This is an important technique in romantic situations, because the audience senses the rapport that is being resisted by one character and pursued by the other. These shots from Magnolia show how a stationary camera can capture this dynamic between the actors, by having one move around a lot while the other remains almost stationary. She busies herself, making coffee, moving all around the room, even leaving it at one point. Most of the time, she has her back to him. This serves the purpose of keeping her face toward the camera (so the viewer can see what she’s feeling), and also shows her resistance toward him. He is more animated. Although he remains in roughly the same position, he angles his body toward hers wherever she goes, making his interest in her clear. At one point he moves closer to her, but quickly backs away when she tries to get past. When she leaves the room, the director holds the camera in the room, without cutting to show where she’s gone, so that the viewer feels an awkward moment of suspension. This scene takes the idea about as far as it can go, and you may not want to emulate this directly. You can, however, use the same principles, even if only briefly. A motionless camera, with one character turning away from the other as she moves around him, creates a strong connection between the two. Don’t think that you always need to have characters facing each other when you’re trying to connect them. Sometimes, a refusal to look at somebody is far more enticing to the audience and emotionally demanding for the character. Magnolia. Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. New Line Cinema, 1999.

5.6,Dance Moves,"Dance scenes are used relentlessly in films, whether the films are about dance or not. This is largely because it gives you, as the director, the opportunity to push two characters together physically, even though they may not yet be close emotionally. This is enjoyable for the audience, and lets them glimpse where the characters might be heading. In terms of camera work, dance scenes offer endless opportunities. In recent years there has been a tendency to throw the camera on the dance floor, and have it circle the actors as they swirl around. Although that can work, this scene shows that when the actors are moving, you have the option to leave the camera exactly where it is. A brief wide shot shows the two characters move together, and then the director cuts to a camera that is at waist height, tilted upward. The camera does not move, apart from the smallest corrections to reframe. Instead, the actors turn, revealing one face and then the other. The actors will be aware of the camera and should time their movements so that one face is visible to the audience at all times. They should not hesitate or linger when somebody’s back is turned to the camera. Be careful, however, not to make it obvious that they are moving their faces into shot. Although the camera setup is simple, this will need extensive rehearsal to get the timing right, to make sure the actors’ movements match the dialogue, and that each face is on screen when you want it be.

5.7,Outsider,"A character who’s seeking connection with others generates sympathy with the audience. You need to film this sort of scene carefully, or the outsider will seem like a whiny intruder. Spielberg shows how this can be done by placing Henry Thomas outside the main group. In the first shot, Thomas is trying to get the attention of the others. Although the audience can see him, he’s on the outside of the group, farthest from the camera, and in a much darker part of the frame. The risk here is that he’s so hidden within the frame that he could almost disappear; so the director has placed his face in the exact center of the frame, both vertically and horizontally. This way, the viewer can’t miss him. The next shot uses a longer lens. Thomas is in roughly the same place, but he is seen from another angle. Most of the frame is taken up with somebody else’s back in silhouette. This pushes the audience to the outside of the circle. This setup achieves three things: It shows that the character is on the outside of the group, it makes the audience feel that they are on the outside with him, and it connects the viewer with him as his is the only face in focus. The third shot looks similar to the opening shot, but is actually from another angle. Now Thomas walks around the table, turning his back to the camera. This again emphasizes his outsider status in the scene, but also shows that he’s asserting himself, pushing himself in the way (quite literally) so that he cannot be ignored. The dialogue that takes place in this scene is frantic, but what’s said is perhaps less important than the relationships that are set up visually. Spielberg also shows that repetition can be a powerful thing. When you work with this idea (physically placing a character in a way that reflects their status), making the point three times — in just a few seconds — will drive it home.

5.8,Playing With Space,"If a meeting between two characters is particularly potent, or emotionally charged, you can reflect this with lens choice. By using a wide range of lenses, you can create the slightly dreamlike feeling that occurs when your emotions run wild. The first shot is more interesting than most over-the-shoulder shots, because it’s taken from further back than usual, placing the character’s face almost central in the screen. This could be because the camera couldn’t be moved any further to the left, since the actors are positioned next to the lockers. Whether intentional or not, the effect is to create a powerful shot of Reece Ritchie, showing his connection to Saoirse Ronan. If the audience only saw her shoulder or the edge of her head, as normally happens, this wouldn’t be as strong, but because more of her head is shown, the audience feels how intently Ritchie is looking at her. In the film itself there is more coverage of the two talking, before the camera cuts to the second frame that’s shown here. This shot is taken from a near- identical camera position, but with a much wider lens. This makes them appear further back, farther apart from each other, and increases the scale of the surrounding corridor. The camera also floats around a little, and the overall effect is one of minor panic and disorientation. Having established a beautiful moment, it is a brave choice of the director to let it drift into a more surreal mood. The next cut surprises the viewer by looking almost straight into Ronan’s eyes. This cements the relationship that has just been established, because now the audience sees the scene from Ritchie’s point of view. A conventional director would probably have shot from the corridor side of the actors, rather than the locker side, and would have been satisfied with angle/reverse angle. You can see that pushing visuals to their extremes can add a lot of potency to a scene, even when the dialogue on the page is relatively simple. The Lovely Bones. Directed by Peter Jackson.

5.9,Pacing,"Characters who make speeches try to connect with the crowd they are talking to. Whether or not this is successful depends on the script, but a director needs to show the effect the speech is having on the crowd. The opening shot of Brad Pitt establishes that he is giving a speech, largely because of his performance. It is an interesting choice, though, because many directors would open a speech scene with a wide establishing shot. In the next shot, the view shifts behind the characters he’s addressing, and the camera dollies with him, keeping him roughly central in the frame. The director keeps Pitt’s performance in view, but also shows how many people are there without resorting to an establishing shot. When he turns around to walk back up the line, the camera cuts to another dolly shot from the other side of Pitt. This time, the camera is focused on those who are listening to him. He remains largely in profile so the viewer can see the essence of his performance while watching the crowd’s reaction to his words. When shooting speeches, you can keep the speechmaker still, standing on a podium, but movement opens up many possibilities. The simple arrangement of actors and two dolly tracks used in this scene makes for a rich and visually powerful setup. There is only one cut, when Pitt changes direction. If you tried to cut between the two setups throughout the scene, everything on screen would appear to be changing direction with each cut. When shooting a scene like this, be certain that you’ve got good footage of the moment that he changes direction, because that is where you will need to cut. Inglourious Basterds.

5.10,Parallel Speech,"Long speeches can be difficult to pull off, especially when there is a lot of exposition taking place. Ideally, your script will keep this to a minimum. If, however, you have a scene that requires somebody to make a relatively long speech to a large crowd, you can maintain interest by making changes in height, angle, and proximity throughout the shot. This is easier to achieve than it might sound. In these shots from A. I. Artificial Intelligence, William Hurt walks down the center of the room. By carefully spacing the extras, the director makes the room seem full. Some of the extras and some props are close to camera, so that as the camera dollies to the left, this movement is emphasized and the shot is kept interesting. The camera then moves around to the left, so the audience meets Hurt as he comes to a halt at the top of the steps. The audience is looking down on him, but rather than seeming diminished, he now appears to have the crowd in the palm of his hands. He is more brightly lit, and he is above them. In capturing the crowd’s attention and rising to such a strong visual position, Spielberg also captures the attention of his film audience. They know from this brief camera move that Hurt is a character worth listening to. As with many of Spielberg’s moves, it is his combination of techniques that makes it powerful. The camera move itself, the actor’s apparent height change, and the ending with him close to camera all contribute to the overall effect. The real challenge with a shot like this is timing the move to exactly match the actor’s performance. If you plan to shoot a scene like this, try to work with an actor who’s capable of accurate timing as well as strong performance. A. I. Artificial Intelligence. Directed by Steven Spielberg.

6.1,Shifting Levels,"At a turning point in your movie, when things step up a gear, you might find it useful to direct your actors to move more energetically through the scene as they talk. This can help to show that change is occurring, and that decisions are being made. These shots from Melinda and Melinda are achieved with a pan and tilt, but because the actors move to different positions on the steps, and because different numbers of people are in the frame at any one time, it makes for a fascinating scene. The opening shot shows the two men leaving the apartment, and Radha Mitchell meets them. She turns to lean against the railing, which helps open this group up, so the audience can see their faces as they talk. The men leave, and she heads up the steps. The camera stays on her and moves in slightly (although the shot would have worked without any move at all). She turns to talk to them at the top of the steps, again ensuring that her face is on screen. It doesn’t matter that they are off screen at this point, because the interest in the scene is whether or not she will join them for a day out. That’s all they are interested in, that’s all the audience is interested in, so the viewer only needs to watch her. The director doesn’t need to cut back to them. She then moves back down the steps and joins them, and the final moments of the conversation show their reactions to her decision, so it doesn’t matter that she has her back to camera. You can execute this type of setup so long as you are willing to let some actors go out of frame. Don’t always try to get absolute coverage of every angle. If you can capture the scene in a more elegant way, do so. Melinda and Melinda. Directed by Woody Allen. Fox Searchlight Pictures, 2005. All rights reserved."
6.2,Close Cut,"Showing both actors in one shot is a good way to shoot a dialogue scene, especially when plot is being revealed. In many cases, you can shoot the whole scene in one take, moving to a second angle as the scene progresses. Or, as shown here, you can cut to the second angle. In the first shot, the characters are focused on the envelope they’ve retrieved from the mailbox. Although the actors angle their heads slightly so that the camera can pick up their faces, they can’t really be seen clearly. The audience is also focused on the envelope. The cut then shifts to a view that is face-on to the actors, shot by a second camera at a similar distance and with a similar lens. The audience, however, is able to see their expressions more clearly because of the cut. To further facilitate this, the director places the actors physically very close to each other. This level of proximity between two people is rare, but it works on screen because when the actors look at each other, they have to really look. You can’t glance at somebody when you’re this close. For the actors, this will feel unnaturally close, and they may need some coaxing. It will be easier to get them to put their faces this close together if you arrange them so their bodies are touching, with one character leaning on the other slightly. Shots such as this help show the relationship between two characters, but when you want to make a plot point that the audience remembers, it helps to limit the number of cuts in the scene. By cutting to this one shot of the characters in close contact, you enable your audience to listen to everything they say. Ghost World. Directed by Terry Zwigoff. United Artists, 2001.

6.3,Hard Reverse,"These shots from Nineteen Eighty-Four show how much power you can achieve with one cut. Most of this scene takes place with the characters walking toward a moving camera, but as they come to rest, the camera jumps to the opposite side of them. This cut comes as a vital plot point is revealed. Master Shots 2 stresses the benefits you can gain from having actors talk without looking at each other. You can mix this up by having one character try to make eye contact, while the other remains uninterested. Here, John Hurt looks across at Richard Burton throughout the whole scene. Burton barely glances at him, and the power imbalance between them is clearly established. As an audience member, you want Burton to look at Hurt, but when he finally does, it is a surprise. The two of them stop walking and turn to face each other. This is a powerful moment, because they are facing each other for the first time in the film, and a major shift in the plot takes place. At this moment, the director cuts to a shot taken from the opposite side of the actors. This cut is powerful because it cuts to the exact opposite angle. A cut to a different angle would not be as powerful as this opposite angle, because the viewer sees the actors reversed in the frame. This suggests that something has been exchanged between them. The lighting here is also crucial, because in the opening shots, both characters are quite brightly lit against the surrounding darkness. But then, as a secret is exchanged, both are thrown into silhouette. It is as though they have entered a secret world together, with nothing more than a cut. When you shoot a scene like this, the cut works most effectively when the audience doesn’t suspect it is coming, so a long, slow walk should precede the moment of change. Nineteen Eighty-Four.

6.4,Face To Face,"There are times when you need to show a character revealing plot points, without him dominating the scene. In these shots from A. I. Artificial Intelligence, it’s important for the audience to see Sam Robards revealing some plot details, but this scene has to be emotionally owned by Frances O’Connor. To achieve the correct balance, the director starts with the two facing each other. Then, as the plot details are revealed, Robards moves around to the side, so that his face is favored. This movement of his could look unnatural or unmotivated, but because the camera is moving in, it appears realistic. Once the plot details have been revealed, Robards needs to move out of the way, so that the focus is on O’Connor’s reaction. To achieve this, Robards moves back to face her. By now the camera is close and looking up. He bends forward and looks up at her, as though trying to get a response from her, which means she can look down at him, thus facing the camera almost directly. If this scene was shot with two characters standing next to each other, the camera cutting from one to the other, it would be dull. By adding a simple camera move, and shifting one actor, Spielberg causes the audience to notice the plot, and then to feel the scene’s emotional charge. As with so many of Spielberg’s setups, the challenge is to make the actors comfortable with moves that are somewhat forced. If the actors are uncomfortable, a scene like this will just look like a flashy setup. You really see the skill of the director here, not in the moves he’s chosen, but in the level of comfort the actors appear to feel when acting out the scene. A. I. Artificial Intelligence.

6.5,Face Up,"During scenes where plot details are revealed, or hinted at, it can help to show that one character knows more than another. This scene from Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me uses three cameras, two of which remain motionless. The camera that is close to Sheryl Lee slowly pushes in on her to show that she is the one in the know. The establishing shot from above does more than just set the scene. Establishing shots can be tiresome, because they can be a lazy way of revealing nothing more than where the scene takes place, and where everybody is positioned. If you’re going to use an establishing shot, it helps to push the image as far as it can go. Here, a high camera with a wide lens looks down on the two characters, who are arranged in unusual positions on chairs. This kind of staging, with actors lying in strange positions, could be dismissed as Lynchian weirdness, but it adds richness to the scene. Real people do not sit or stand talking to each other the way they do in soap operas. Real people flop and lie and position themselves all over the furniture. With the establishing shot out of the way, the director cuts to shots of their faces, but as the conversation takes place, only the camera above Lee pushes in. This shows an imbalance of power; she is the one who knows what’s going on. Although she is the victim of much that goes on in this film, the camera move here makes it clear that she is the one on the inside of the mystery. When moving your camera, even in small, slow moves such as this, remember that it can have a huge effect on how each character is perceived. Had the director pushed the camera in on both actors, it would have a completely different effect. Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me. Directed by David Lynch. New Line Cinema, 1992. All rights reserved."
6.6,Background Switch,"When one character reveals key information to another, there is often a sense of discomfort. In this scene from V for Vendetta, the character that’s seated at the beginning is reluctant to share his suspicions. By starting the scene with the character’s back to the camera, the director suggests his reluctance. The second character faces the camera, asks a question, and then moves to the left to sit down. As he does so, the first character crosses the frame, and the camera follows him. He moves across the room simply to get a drink of water. In other words, there is nothing in the plot that requires him to move. He could sit where he is and say what he thinks. The reason the director gets him to stand up is that by moving him across the frame and past the second character, we feel his unease. By having him move from one side of the frame to the other, without a cut, the director shows a subtle change is going on. The fact that the first character’s back remains turned to camera at the end of the shot also reflects his unease. He glances across at the second character, but only slightly. The camera itself does not move position, but pans to follow him. It’s an alarmingly simple setup, with the characters’ movements and orientation to the camera dictating the level of discomfort. Don’t underestimate the effect that can be created by shifting the character from one side of the frame to the other. Although people move around scenes all the time, when you do it in a slow way, in one move, without a cut, it raises the tension. The plot revelation becomes far more interesting than if the characters merely looked at each other and spoke their lines. V for Vendetta. Directed by James McTeigue. Warner Bros., 2005.

6.7,Invisible Barrier,"While plot is being revealed, it is important that the audience remains interested in characters and relationships. These shots from The Reader show one character’s resistance to the other’s attention. The dialogue is minimal, so the layers of character are added by careful positioning of the actors and the camera to create the impression of a barrier between the characters. The first shot shows David Kross with his back turned to the camera. Although he looks over his shoulder at Karoline Herfurth, he does not immediately turn to face her. She stands in the doorway, and although her face is turned toward him, she does not enter the room. This is the threshold she will not cross, and it serves to create some distance between them. Rather than shooting over-the-shoulder shots, the director has chosen to place each character in their own frame, further separating them from each other. Although there is a hint of a possible relationship between the two, the barrier prevents them from getting close. In the final shot of Kross, a longer, more flattering lens is used to create a little more intimacy, but although he now faces her directly, his body is turned away. He has not shifted around in his seat, and this maintains the dislocation between the two. Scenes like this are effective because they pull the audience in two directions at once. In terms of the plot and facial expressions, we sense a growing intimacy between these people, but this is contradicted by everything else on screen. You can add great depth to a scene by manipulating this contradiction. The Reader. Directed by Stephen Daldry. The Weinstein Company, 2008. All rights reserved."
